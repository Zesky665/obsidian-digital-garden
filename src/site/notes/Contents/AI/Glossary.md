### Epoch
	An epoch is the number of times the enitre dataset has passed though the algorith.

### Iteration
	An iteration represents the number of batches required to pass the dataset thoutugh the algorithm.

### Batch
	A batch represents the number of samples taken from the dataset and fed into the algorithm before the model is recalibrated. 

### Learning Curve/Gradient
	A graph with x = time and y = accuracy, it's populated with valuation data from each iteration of a model training. It's used to determine if a model is over/under trained.
