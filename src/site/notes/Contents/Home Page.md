My name is Zharko Cekovski and this is my digital garden. 

### What is a digital garden? 
A digital garden is like a cross between a personal blog and a knowledge base. 
This is where I keep my knowledge accumulated over my career in a series of interconnected notes. 
Mine is powered by [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), for a more detailed explanation you can follow this [link](https://github.com/oleeskild/Obsidian-Digital-Garden). 

### Who are you exactly?
I am a Data Engineering Consultant, I'm been helping clients with their data pipelines for the past 2 years. 
On a personal note, I live in Skopje, I like DnD and long walks by the river. 

### Can you help me with [X]?
Probably, feel free to [email](zharkoc@zharconsulting.com) me or set up a meeting in [calendly](https://calendly.com/zharkoc/30min). 
The first consultation is free.
